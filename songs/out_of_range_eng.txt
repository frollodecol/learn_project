Everything is done easily
World pendulum is shaking
And the light switches to the sound
On distance of the short
It hasn't sence to consider
That the truth will not sneak away from your hands
And infinite circle will not tear.

Out of range of access we are not identified
Out of range of access we breathe air
Out of range of access
We are there quite consciously
We are out of range of access
Out of range of access

It's unnecessary
To wait help of rescuers
Because there are only two steps tangentially upward
Two life before convergence
And then to exhaustion
Hiding the location
They are invisible behind interference band.

Out of range of access we are not identified
Out of range of access we breathe air 
Out of range of access
We are out of range of access quite consciously
Out of range of access...
